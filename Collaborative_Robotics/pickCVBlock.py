#This code is a simplified implementation of a collaborative robotics system that detects plates and targets using computer vision, 
#and then commands a Dobot robotic arm to pick and place objects accordingly. The system operates in three phases: scanning for plates, 
#scanning for targets, and executing the pick/place operations. 
#Stability checks are implemented to ensure reliable detection before proceeding to the next phase.

# Note: there are parameters that are useful to the successful operation of the robot arm. Read through the code before running the program.

# How to use: 
# 1. Ensure you have the Dobot robotic arm set up and connected to your computer.
# 2. Place the plates (drop zones) and targets (red blocks) within the camera's
# field of view.
# 3. Run the script. The system will first scan for plates, then targets, and finally execute the pick/place operations based on the detected positions.
# 4. Monitor the console output and the video feed for feedback on the system's status and operations

#Other Useful Codes you can use:
#dobotArm.move_to_xyz(api, pick_x, pick_y, Z_SAFE, rHead): moves the robot to the specified (x, y, z) coordinates with a specified rotation for the end effector (rHead). Z_SAFE is a predefined constant that ensures the robot maintains a safe height to avoid collisions when moving horizontally.
